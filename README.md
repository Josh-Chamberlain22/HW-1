## Animal Class
  * The animal class is the base class for all other classes in the project.
  * PrintInfo()
    * The function outputs all the information about one animal. 
  * MakeNoise()
    * The function outputs a noise specific to what type of animal it is as seen in later derived classes.
  * AgeUp()
    * The function ages up the animal by one year.

  * PrintInfo()
    * Refer to PrintInfo() in the Animal class.

## Design Decisions
  * I chose to make my class choice a dolphin because they are one of the smartest animals on Earth.
  * I chose sounds based on real world experience.
  * The menu allows you to print info for all animals or the user can choose a specific one. This added functionality was implemented to avoid having to loop over and over again for a single type of animal.
